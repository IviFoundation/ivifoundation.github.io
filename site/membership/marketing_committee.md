# Marketing Committee

The marketing committee is a committee of members that reports to the
IVI Foundation Board of Directors. IVI Foundation members can have
representatives attend and participate in marketing committee meetings,
and those representatives need not be directors. The marketing committee
is the primary body within the IVI Foundation that is responsible for
promoting the benefits of IVI to the user as well as the editorial
communities. The marketing committee maintains the IVI Foundation Web
site, generates collateral to promote IVI, and holds press events at
International industry exhibits and conferences such as APEX,
Autotestcon, and Productronica.
