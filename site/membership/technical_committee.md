# Technical Committee

The IVI Technical Committee is perhaps the most important group of all
IVI Committees. It typically consists of all voting members. It is
chartered with overseeing all technical work with in the IVI
organization. The IVI Technical Committee charters all new Technical
Working Groups and selects the working group chairperson. These Working
Groups meet separately (with the help and advice of the Technical
Committee Chairman) and report back on a regular basis. The Technical
Committee keeps track of all specifications under development, and
regularly reviews progress. Once a Working Group has approved a
specification, they submit it to the Technical Committee Chairperson,
who is responsible to publish the draft specification and conduct a
formal VOTE involving all voting members of IVI.
