# Committees

Virtually all work within the IVI foundation is done in Committees that
are appointed by the board of directors.

Foremost is the [Technical Committee](technical_committee.html), which
is the technical arm of the IVI Foundation; sub-groups of the Technical
Committee, called working groups, develop the IVI specifications.

However, there is other important work to be done. With Anti-trust and
Intellectual Property (IP) issues to be considered, we must be careful
to obey the law and be careful to handle software issues properly. This
is the job of the [Legal Committee](legal_committee.html).

We feel that IVI is a significant contribution to the state-of-the-art
of configuring and maintaining a robust ATE system that can be
maintained through generations of test equipment. However, inventing the
solution is not enough. We must make sure that potential customers
understand the power and benefits of IVI drivers, so that the will be
widely adopted. This is the job of the [Marketing Committee](marketing_committee.html).

The IVI Foundation is fortunate to have a strong group of current and
potential IVI users as members. These users provide constructive
feedback on how to make the IVI specifications, and especially the
current implementation of IVI drivers, as useful and beneficial as
possible to users. This feedback is the main task of the [Users Committee](user_committee.html).

Finally the [Operating Procedures Committee](operating_procedures_committee.html) is working to formalize
and streamline IVI's internal operating procedures and policies.
