# Legal Committee

The legal committee is a committee of members that reports to the IVI
Foundation Board of Directors. IVI Foundation members can have
representatives attend and participate in legal committee meetings, and
those representatives need not be directors. The legal committee is
responsible for working with the IVI Foundation attorneys and advising
the Board of Directors on amending the IVI Foundation by-laws, creating
intellectual property policies, and generating various legal documents,
such as IP license agreements and software click license agreements.
