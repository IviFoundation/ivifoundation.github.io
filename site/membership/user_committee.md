# Users Committee

The Users Committee reports directly to the Board of Directors. Its
chairperson is typically one of the User members. Members are generally
all IVI user members plus those vendor members who choose to attend.
However, the chairperson of the committee reserves the right to curtail
discussion if it varies from IVI user focus. The purpose if the Users
committee is to provide feedback to the entire organization on the
usability and impact of commercial IVI drivers on the user community.
They are chartered to give honest feedback to help improve the IVI
standards and their implementation. In particular, if they see something
that is not working well, or a Instrument class that they feel is
important to be added, we depend on their feedback to bring it to the
group's attention.
