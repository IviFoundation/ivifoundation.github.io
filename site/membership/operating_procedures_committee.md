# Operating Procedures Committee

The Operating Procedures Committee is responsible for IVI specification
1.2, the IVI Operating Procedures. IVI-1.2 Operating Procedures describe
IVI Foundation rules and practices regarding how we conduct business.
All discussions and business conducted in any forum within the
foundation must conform to these procedures.

The bylaws provide some basic guidelines on operating procedures.
IVI-1.2 IVI Operating procedures provides additional detail and
procedures about such topics as conducting meetings, determining quorum,
and taking votes by e-mail and in person. If the Operating Procedures
are ever found to be in conflict with the bylaws, that is a flaw in the
Operating Procedures and the bylaws take precedence.
