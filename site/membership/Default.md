# Members Documents Have Moved to SharePoint

IVI Foundation members have access to working group documents and
communication. These documents are now available on the [IVI SharePoint site](http://ivifoundation.sharepoint.com). To access the [IVI SharePoint site](http://ivifoundation.sharepoint.com) site, you must
first have a Microsoft Account. Then, you must request access to the
site from [Aaron Hall](mailto:execdir@ivifoundation.org), the Director
of Services for the IVI Foundation.
