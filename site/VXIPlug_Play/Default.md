# VXI*plug&play*

The VXI*plug&play* Systems Alliance was an organization whose members
shared a common commitment to end-user success with open, multivendor
VXI systems. The alliance accomplished major improvements in ease of use
by endorsing and implementing common standards and practices in both
hardware and software, beyond the scope of the VXIbus specifications.
The alliance used both formal and de facto standards to define complete
system frameworks. These standard frameworks gave end-users "plug &
play" interoperability at both the hardware and system software level.

## Integration into the IVI Foundation

The VXI*plug&play* Systems Alliance voted to become part of the IVI
Foundation in late 2002 and the IVI Foundation Board of Directors voted
to accept the merger in the spring of 2003. The VISA technical committee
of the VXI*plug&play* Systems Alliance has been meeting in conjunction
with the IVI Foundations meetings since 2002, and it is now formally
integrated into IVI IVI has assumed control of the VXI*plug&play*
specifications and all ongoing work will be accomplished as part of the
IVI Foundation.

The current, IVI-maintained VISA specification is available at
[Specifications](../specifications/default.html).
