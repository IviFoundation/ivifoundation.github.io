After several months of collaboration between the IVI Foundation and the
LXI Consortium, IVI is pleased to announce the completion of the [IVI Python Specification](https://github.com/IviFoundation/IviDrivers/blob/main/IviDriverPython/1.0/Spec/IviDriverPython.md).  

This new specification, in conjunction with the previously announced [IVI ANSI-C Specification](https://github.com/IviFoundation/IviDrivers/blob/main/IviDriverAnsiC/1.0/Spec/IviDriverAnsi-C.md) and [IVI .NET Specification](https://github.com/IviFoundation/IviDrivers/blob/main/IviDriverNet/1.0/Spec/IviDriverNet.md) provide effective driver standards for the most popular languages used in Test and Measurement today.

In June of 2025 the LXI Foundation proposed that the IVI Foundation
develop IVI language-specific specifications for Python and ANSI-C, based on
the [IVI Driver Core Specification](https://github.com/IviFoundation/IviDrivers/blob/main/IviDriverCore/1.0/Spec/IviDriverCore.md).
The IVI Driver Core Specification was completed early in 2025.With the completion of the IVI Python standard, both of these specifications requested by LXI are complete.

The new IVI Python spec becomes part of the [IVI Generation 2026](https://www.ivifoundation.org/specifications/default.html#generation-2026-driver-specifications) set of specifications.

All of the IVI Generation 2026 standards are being developed and managed
under GitHub. IVI is doing this to makes the standards more accessible
to driver developers and users that want to propose additions. Driver
users and developers are encouraged to participate by creating
discussions in the [IVI Drivers repository](https://github.com/IviFoundation/IviDrivers) on GitHub.
