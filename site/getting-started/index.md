## IVI Instrument Driver Fundamentals Course

In this two-hour class, you will learn about the types of IVI drivers,
how to use them, and how to select between them.

Taking this class will help you get started creating test programs to
control instruments and give you a better understanding of how to use
the IVI features. The classes are open to the public free of charge at
our IVI Foundation meetings in the US, Europe and China.
Contact [Aaron Hall](mailto:execdir@ivifoundation.org), Director of Services, IVI
Foundation, to get the date and location of the next course.

The course is taught and recorded in video sections by Joe Mueller,
Keysight Technologies, former President of the IVI Foundation. The video
demos are produced by the IVI Foundation and National Instruments, a
Sponsor Member of the IVI Foundation.
