# SCPI Consortium

The Standard Commands for Programmable Instrumentation (SCPI) Consortium
was an organization whose members shared a common commitment to develop
a common interface language between computers and test instruments. The
SCPI Standard is built on the foundation of IEEE-488.2, Standard Codes
and Formats. It requires conformance to IEEE-488.2, but is pure software
standard. SCPI syntax is ASCII text, and therefore can be attached to
any computer test language, such as BASIC, C, or C++. It can also be
used with Test Application Environments such as LabWindows/CVI, LabVIEW,
MATLAB, Microsoft Visual Studio, or Agilent VEE. SCPI is
hardware-independent. SCPI strings can be sent over any instrument
interface. It works equally well over GPIB, RS-232, VXIbus or LAN
networks.

  

# Integration into the IVI Foundation

The SCPI Consortium voted to become part of the IVI Foundation in late
2002 and the IVI Foundation Board of Directors voted to accept the
merger in the spring of 2003. IVI has assumed control of the SCPI
specifications and all ongoing work will be accomplished as part of the
IVI Foundation.
