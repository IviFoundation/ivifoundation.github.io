## IVI Foundation Completes Instrument Driver Specifications

HUNTSVILLE, Ala. - Oct. 15, 2002 -The Interchangeable Virtual
Instrumentation (IVI) Foundation, an open consortium of companies that
sets software standards for instrument interchangeability, announced the
completion of all the specifications required for IVI-compliant
instrument drivers and systems. The new IVI specifications help users
meet engineering challenges, such as preserving software on long-life
test systems when instruments become obsolete, or maximizing the use of
existing resources by deploying a single test software system on to test
systems built with different instrument hardware.
