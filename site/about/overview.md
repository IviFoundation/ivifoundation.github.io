# Overview

The IVI standards define an open driver architecture, a set of
instrument classes, and shared software components. Together these
provide critical elements needed for instrument interchangeability.

**Benefits**

IVI offers several benefits to measurement system designers:

  - IVI's defined Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) standardize
    common measurement functions reducing the time needed to learn a new
    IVI instrument.
  - Instrument simulation allows developers to run code without an
    instrument. This feature reduces the need for sometimes scarce
    measurement hardware hardware resources and it can simplify testing
    of measurement applications.
  - IVI drivers feature enhanced ease of use in popular Application
    Development Environments. IVI's standard APIs, combined with IVI
    driver wrappers where appropriate, provide fast, intuitive access to
    driver functions.
  - IVI drivers provide for interchangeability. Interchangeability
    reduces the time and effort needed to integrate measurement devices
    into new or existing systems

**Interchangeability**

Systems designed with IVI drivers enjoy the benefits of standardized
code that can be interchanged into other systems. This code also
supports interchange of measurement devices -- helping to prevent
hardware obsolescence. Interchangeability is supported on three levels:
The IVI architecture specifications allow architectural
interchangeability -- that is a standard driver architecture that can be
reused. The class specifications provide syntactic interchangeability
which supports instrument exchange with minimal code changes. The
highest level of interchangeability is achieved by using the IVI signal
specifications.
