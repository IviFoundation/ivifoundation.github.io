# IPR Policy

The IVI Foundation has adopted intellectual property rights policies and
procedures in order to minimize the possibility of inadvertent
infringement of the patent and other intellectual property rights
(collectively, "IPR") of an IPR owner by members of the Consortium using
any Consortium specifications or software products.
