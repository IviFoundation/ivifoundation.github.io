# SCPI Consortium

The Standard Commands for Programmable Instrumentation (SCPI) Consortium
is an organization whose members share a common commitment to develop a
common interface language between computers and test instruments. The
SCPI Standard is built on the foundation of IEEE-488.2, Standard Codes
and Formats. It requires conformance to IEEE-488.2, but is pure software
standard. SCPI syntax is ASCII text, and therefore can be attached to
any computer test language, such as BASIC, C, or C++. It can also be
used with Test Application Environments such as LabWindows/CVI, LabVIEW,
or HP VEE. SCPI is Hardware Independent. SCPI strings can be sent over
any instrument interface. It works equally well over GPIB, RS-232,
VXIbus or LAN networks.

**Integration into the IVI Foundation**

The SCPI Consortium voted to become part of the IVI Foundation in late
2002 and the IVI Foundation Board of Directors voted to accept the
merger in the spring of 2003. IVI has assumed control of the SCPI 
specifications and all ongoing
work will be accomplished as part of the IVI Foundation.
