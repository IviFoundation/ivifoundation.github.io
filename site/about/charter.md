# Charter

The primary purpose of the IVI Foundation is to promote the development
and adoption of standards for programming test instruments. In doing so,
the Foundation focuses on the needs of people that build and maintain
high performance test systems with off-the-shelf instrument drivers. The
IVI Foundation builds on existing industry standards to create
specifications that simplify interchanging instruments and provide
better performance and simplified maintenance.
