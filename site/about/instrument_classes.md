# Instrument Classes

To enable interchangeability, the foundation creates IVI class
specifications that define the base class capabilities and class
extension capabilities for some of the most popular instrument classes.
There are currently thirteen instrument classes defined:

- Digital multimeter (DMM)
- Oscilloscope
- Arbitrary waveform/function generator
- DC power supply
- AC power supply
- Switch
- Power meter
- Spectrum analyzer
- RF signal generator
- Upconverter
- Downconverter
- Digitizer
- Counter/timer

Future work includes defining additional class specifications and
extending the scope of current specifications to cover more instrument
functionality.

Instrument class specifications are available on the
[Specifications](../specifications/default.html) page.
