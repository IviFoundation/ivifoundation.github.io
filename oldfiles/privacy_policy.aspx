        <strong>Children’s Privacy </strong>
            <p>
                IVI Foundation is committed to protecting the privacy needs of children, and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities and interests. IVI Foundation does not intentionally collect information from children under the age of 13, and IVI Foundation does not target its web site to children. 
            </p>
            <br />

        <strong>TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT </strong>
            <br /><br />
        <strong>Non-Personal Information </strong>
            <p>
                Non-personal information is data about usage and service operation that is not directly associated with a specific personal identity. IVI Foundation may collect and analyze non-personal information to evaluate how visitors use the IVI Foundation web site. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Non-personal data we may collect may track pages visited on the IVI Foundation web site, web browser type and IP address, files downloaded, and referring web sites. IVI Foundation web pages may use “cookies” and other technologies for data analysis and personalization services.  Cookies are pieces of information that we may place on your computer to help “personalize” your visit to the site.  Cookies do not identify who you are or where you are.  The cookie only tells us that you have visited the site before and may contain certain information about your prior visits.  No cookie used by the web site collects or distributes personal information to third parties for marketing purposes. 
            </p>
        
        <strong>Company Information </strong>
            <p>
                Company information is information that is associated with the name and address of member organizations and may include data about usage and service operation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Primary Representative of any IVI Foundation member organization may request usage reports to gauge the extent of their employees’ involvement in consortium activities.  Employees should be aware that information regarding their participation (e.g., IVI Foundation Technical Committees or Working Groups they join) is available to their Primary Representative and IVI Foundation staff. 
            </p>
        
        <strong>Personal Information </strong>
            <p>
                Personal information is information that is associated with your name or personal identity.  IVI Foundation uses personal information to better understand your needs and interests and to provide you with better service. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On some IVI Foundation web pages, you may be able to request information, subscribe to mailing lists, participate in online discussions, collaborate on documents, provide feedback, submit information into registries, register for events, apply for membership, or join technical committees or working groups. The types of personal information you provide to us on these pages may include name, address, phone number, e-mail address, user IDs, passwords, billing information, or credit card information. 
            </p>
        
        <strong>Members-Only Web Site Information Gathering </strong>
            <p>
                Access to various sections of the IVI Foundation web site may be restricted to members of the consortium. Access to these resources may be controlled by a user name and password; a password prompt is your indication that a members-only resource is being accessed. 
            </p>
        
        <strong>How We Use Your Information </strong>
            <p>
                IVI Foundation may use non-personal data that is aggregated for reporting about IVI Foundation web site usability, performance, and effectiveness.  It may be used to improve the experience, usability, and content of the site. 
            </p>
            <p>
                IVI Foundation may use personal information to provide services that support the activities of IVI Foundation members and their collaboration on IVI Foundation standards.  When accessing IVI Foundation members-only web pages, your personal user information may be tracked by IVI Foundation in order to support collaboration, ensure authorized access, and enable communication between members.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Credit card information may be collected to facilitate membership applications; such information will not be kept longer than necessary for providing the services requested. Credit card numbers are used only for processing payment and are not used for other purposes. Payment processing services may be provided by a third-party payment service and a management company external to IVI Foundation may provide support for the financial activities of the consortium. 
            </p>
    
        <strong>Information Sharing </strong>
            <p>
                IVI Foundation will not give away, share, sell, rent, or lease any individual’s personal information or lists of email addresses to anyone for marketing purposes, and we take commercially reasonable steps to maintain the security of this information.  However, IVI Foundation reserves the right to supply any such information to any organization into which IVI Foundation may merge in the future or to which it may make any transfer in order to enable a third party to continue part or all of its mission.  In addition, please be aware that in certain circumstances, it is possible that personal information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In keeping with our open process, IVI Foundation may maintain publicly accessible archives for the vast majority of our activities.  For example, posting an email to any IVI Foundation-hosted mail list or discussion forum will result in your email address becoming part of the publicly accessible archives.  
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are a registered member of IVI Foundation, you should be aware that some items of your personal information may be visible to other IVI Foundation members and to the public.  The IVI Foundation member database may retain information about your name, e-mail address, company affiliation (if an organizational member), and such other personal address and identifying data as you choose to supply.  That data may be generally visible to other IVI Foundation members and to the public.  Your name, e-mail address, and other information you may supply, also may be associated in the IVI Foundation’s publicly accessible records with IVI Foundation’s various committees, working groups, and similar activities that you join, in various places, including: 1) the permanently-posted attendance and membership records of those activities; 2) documents generated by the activity, which may be permanently archived; and, 3) along with message content, in the permanent archives of IVI Foundation’s e-mail lists, which also may be public.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Given the international scope of IVI Foundation, personal information may be visible to persons outside your country of residence, including to persons in countries that your own country’s privacy laws and regulations deem deficient in ensuring an adequate level of protection for such information. 
            </p>
    
        <strong>If you do not want your personal information collected and used by IVI Foundation, please do not visit IVI Foundation’s web site or apply for membership. </strong>
        <br /><br />
    
        <strong>Access to and Accuracy of Member Information </strong>
            <p>
                IVI Foundation is committed to keeping the personal information of our members accurate.  All the information you have submitted to us can be verified and changed.  In order to do this, 
                please email us a request at <a href="mailto:IVIinfo@ivifoundation.org">IVIinfo@ivifoundation.org</a>.  We may provide members with online access to their own personal profiles, enabling 
                them to update or delete information at any time. To protect our members’ privacy and security, we also may take reasonable steps to verify identity, such as a user ID and password, before 
                granting access to modify personal profile data. Certain areas of IVI Foundation’s web sites may limit access to specific individuals through the use of passwords or other personal identifiers. 
            </p>
    
        <strong>Keeping Your Information Secure </strong>
            <p>
                IVI Foundation makes every effort to protect personal information by users of the web site, including using firewalls and other security measures on its servers.  No server, however, is 100% secure, and you should take this into account when submitting personal or confidential information about yourself on any web site, including this one.  Much of the personal information is used in conjunction with member services such as collaboration and discussion, so some types of personal information such as your name, company affiliation, and email address will be visible to other IVI Foundation members and to the public. 
            </p>
    
        <strong>Opting Out </strong>
            <p>
                From time to time IVI Foundation may email you electronic newsletters, announcements, surveys or other information.  If you prefer not to receive any or all of these communications, you may opt out by following the directions provided within the electronic newsletters and  announcements. 
            </p>
